      <p><em>Last updated: 2025-05-21</em></p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how EEEY SpA (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects and uses your personal information when you download, install, and use the EEEY SpA mobile application (the “App”).</p>

        <h2>2. Consent of the user</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, and using the Mobile application, you (also referred to as the "User") voluntarily provide written consent for the processing of your Personal Information as specified in this Policy.</p>

        <h2>3. General Terms</h2>
        <p>This Policy constitutes an integral part of the End User License Agreement (EULA) for the Mobile application. By downloading and utilizing the Mobile application, you fully accept the terms outlined in this Policy.</p>
        <p>The methods for processing Personal Information include actions such as collection, recording, systematization, storage, updating, extraction, use, transfer, depersonalization, blocking, deletion, and destruction, with or without automated facilities.</p>
        <p>Terms from the EULA and other agreements with the User are applicable unless explicitly stated otherwise in this Policy.</p>

        <h2>4. Legal Basis &amp; Compliance</h2>
        <p>We process your data based on our legitimate interests in improving the App and, where required, your explicit consent. California residents may opt-out under the CCPA; EU users have rights under the GDPR.</p>

        <h2>5. Scope of Collected Data</h2>
        <p><strong>Personal Data You Provide:</strong> Email address and social media handles (only when you opt into surveys).</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Device model, OS version, session duration, in-app events, crash logs, via third-party analytics.</p>

        <h2>6. Third Party Software</h2>
        <p>The Mobile Application may integrate third-party providers—such as Amplitude, Intercom, AppsFlyer, Facebook SDK, Firebase (including Crashlytics), Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Sentry—to collect and transmit de-identified usage data (for example, device details, in-app events, performance metrics and crash reports). Each provider processes this information under its own privacy policy, and your use of the Application constitutes acceptance of those terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>EEEY SpA does not intentionally collect personal data from children under 16. If such information is inadvertently obtained, it will be promptly deleted upon discovery.</p>

        <h2>8. Purposes of personal information processing</h2>
        <p>We may use Personal Information for communication, marketing, statistical research, and targeting advertising based on depersonalized data.</p>

        <h2>9. User's rights</h2>
        <p>The User has rights to be informed, access, correct, restrict, object, withdraw consent, delete personal data, and receive data for portability. These rights can be exercised by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>10. Transfer of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We may transfer Personal Information to third parties with User consent, for Mobile application functionality, third-party service providers, or asset transfers.</p>

        <h2>11. Amendments and deletion</h2>
        <p>For questions, amendments, or deletion requests regarding Personal Information, users can contact us at contact@eeey.app</p>

        <h2>12. Amendments to the Policy</h2>
        <p>We will update this Policy and the “Last updated” date on this page. Significant changes will be announced via in-App notification and email.</p>
