      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how EEEY SpA (“EEEY,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you download, install, or use our mobile applications and related services (collectively, the “Apps”).</p>
      <p>For terms governing your use of the Apps, please see our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. For support, visit <a href="support.html">Support</a> or email <a href="mailto:contact@eeey.app">contact@eeey.app</a>.</p>

      <h2>2. What We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> contact details (e.g., email), messages to support, optional survey responses, and any user-generated content you choose to submit (for example, photos, videos, text, or other media) to use features in the Apps.</p>
      <p><strong>Usage & diagnostics:</strong> device model, OS/app version, language, time zone, session duration, screens viewed, in-app events, performance metrics, and crash logs.</p>
      <p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> app-scoped identifiers (e.g., installation ID), and—only if you grant permission under Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (“ATT”)—identifiers used for cross-app tracking by third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Location (optional):</strong> if you grant permission, we may collect approximate or precise location to power or enhance specific features. You can disable location in your device settings.</p>
      <p><strong>Metadata in media (optional):</strong> if you submit media that contains embedded metadata (e.g., EXIF/GPS), we may read it only to provide or improve features and results.</p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate core functionality of the Apps.</li>
        <li>Maintain, secure, debug, and improve performance and quality.</li>
        <li>Customer support and service communications.</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, or violations of our Terms.</li>
        <li>With your consent where required: optional analytics, attribution, and marketing communications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal Bases (GDPR/UK GDPR)</h2>
      <p>We process personal data based on: (a) performance of a contract (to provide the Apps); (b) our legitimate interests (e.g., security, improvement); and (c) your consent where required (e.g., precise location, cross-app tracking, optional analytics/marketing). You can withdraw consent at any time via in-App settings (where available) or by contacting us.</p>

      <h2>5. User-Generated Content & Retention</h2>
      <p>Content you submit (e.g., photos, videos, or other media) is processed to provide the requested features and results. Unless we ask and you opt in to allow contribution for model or feature improvement, we delete such content within <strong>30 days</strong> of upload. We do not use your content for marketing without your explicit consent.</p>
      <p>We retain other personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by law. Support records and diagnostic logs may be kept for up to <strong>24 months</strong> to help resolve issues and for compliance.</p>

      <h2>6. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) & Your Choices</h2>
      <p>We request permission before tracking your activity across apps and websites owned by other companies. If you decline, we do not enable cross-app tracking identifiers. You can change this anytime in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics opt-out:</strong> disable optional analytics (where available) in the App settings or contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@eeey.app">contact@eeey.app</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing emails:</strong> use the unsubscribe link in any message or contact us.</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> disable in device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Sharing & Disclosures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> we share data with vendors who process it on our behalf to operate, secure, and improve the Apps (e.g., hosting, content delivery, analytics, crash reporting, customer support).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal/safety:</strong> to comply with law, enforce our Terms, or protect rights, property, and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, or asset sale (we will notify you where required).</li>
        <li><strong>No sale of personal information:</strong> we do not sell your personal information. If this changes, we will provide required notices and opt-out options.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Third-Party Providers</h2>
      <p>We may use providers such as Apple, Google/Firebase (including Crashlytics), Sentry, and analytics platforms (e.g., Amplitude or Mixpanel). These providers process data under their privacy terms and our instructions. Some may be located outside your country. See “International Transfers.”</p>

      <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>When transferring data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent mechanisms) as required by applicable law.</p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data, including encryption in transit and access controls. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Apps are not directed to children under <strong>13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it. For regions where consent age is higher, we comply with applicable law.</p>

      <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, object to processing, withdraw consent, and receive a portable copy of your data. California residents may also request details about data “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising and opt out of such sharing.</p>
      <p><strong>How to exercise your rights:</strong></p>

        <li>Specify your request (e.g., access, deletion, portability, opt-out, withdraw consent).</li>
        <li>We may request information to verify your identity. We aim to respond within <strong>30 days</strong> (or the timeframe required by law).</li>
