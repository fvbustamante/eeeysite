      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>How can I get an invoice after my purchase?</h3>
        <p>Once your payment is processed, the App Store automatically sends a receipt to your Apple ID email.</p>
        <p>If you didn’t receive it, reach out to the App Store. Since subscriptions are processed by the app stores, we can’t generate invoices on your behalf.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>How can I switch to a different payment plan?</h3>
        <p>Change plans directly on your iPhone or iPad:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
          <li>Tap your name → <strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</li>
          <li>Select the subscription you want to modify.</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>See All Plans</strong> and follow the on-screen steps.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Tip:</em> Depending on Apple’s policy, changes may apply at the next billing cycle.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>How do I check my plan and renewal or expiration date?</h3>
        <p>The App Store emails a receipt to the address linked to your Apple ID after each purchase or renewal. That receipt includes your plan details and the next renewal or expiration date.</p>
        <p>If you can’t find the receipt, please contact the App Store directly. Because purchases are handled through the app stores, we’re not able to issue invoices ourselves.</p>
