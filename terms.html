We may update, modify, limit, or discontinue parts of the App at any time, consistent with applicable app-store policies. Free Services may be technically limited and are subject to change.</p>

      <h2>3. Authorization</h2>
      <p>Subject to these Terms and applicable app-store rules, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App on a device you own or control, solely for personal or internal business purposes. You may not redistribute the App or circumvent in-app purchase mechanisms. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and device.</p>

      <h2>4. User Content</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of your User Content. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, process, transmit, and display User Content to operate, maintain, and improve the App and Services. You represent that you have the necessary rights to submit the content and that it complies with applicable laws. We are not responsible for any loss of User Content; keep your own backups.</p>

      <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to access source code; (b) remove or circumvent security or purchase mechanisms; (c) use the App to upload illegal, infringing, harmful, or deceptive content; (d) interfere with or disrupt the App or related services; or (e) use automated scripts or bots without our prior written consent.</p>

      <h2>6. Provider and User obligations</h2>
      <p>We will provide the Services with reasonable skill and care. You must pay applicable Subscription Fees, comply with these Terms and applicable laws, and maintain accurate account information.</p>

      <h2>7. Term and termination</h2>
      <p>These Terms apply from the Effective Date and continue until terminated. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms or where required by law. You may stop using the App at any time.

      <h2>8. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>Certain features of the App require a paid subscription. We offer auto-renewable subscriptions on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis. The exact price for each plan is displayed in the App at the time of purchase and may vary depending on your region.</p>
      <p>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account upon purchase confirmation. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. The renewal will be charged to your account within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same rate unless otherwise stated.</p>
      <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your Apple ID Account Settings. Any unused portion of a free trial, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>

      <h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The App may integrate third-party services (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, authentication). Your use of such services may be subject to their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.</p>

      <h2>11. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>The App, including its design, text, graphics, and software, is owned by or licensed to us and protected by law. Except for the rights expressly granted, no license is provided. All trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

      <h2>12. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US FOR THE APP IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>

      <h2>15. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms with a new “Last updated” date and, for material changes, provide in-App notice or email where feasible. Your continued use of the App after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>
